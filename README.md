     How to achieve Bitmap look on the web
    </h3>
  </summary>
  <p>
  Without bitmap embedded fonts. It is practically futile to achieve the look on Windows with your own custom font even after following <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/bitmap-font-css">this guide.</a><br />
  If you don't care about custom fonts, use the following fonts:
  <ul>
    <li>MS Gothic (monospaced)</li>
    <li>MS PGothic, MS UI Gothic (proportional)</li>
  </ul>
  Be cautious that the fonts will retain the pixel-perfect raster look <strong>only when viewed at certain sizes</strong> that the bitmap was embedded. <br />
  If the font size made at 8pt, it scales best at multiples of 8pt. <br />
  I tried changing the sizes through the CSS and found that MS Gothic fonts are viewed best 22px and under. No bigger and it'll be vectorized(?)
